# Google Maps API

Webpage that displays Middle Tennessee using the Google Maps API. Minor styling done by Bootstrap 4. All markers and animation are done via JavaScript. To run the page, you'll need to register for a Google API Key and place in in the script tag. See code block below.

`<script  async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key="<!--YOU API KEY GOES HERE-->"&callback=initMap"></script>`
